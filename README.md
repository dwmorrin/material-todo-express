# Todo list using Vite, Material UI, and Express

## Initial commit

Welcome!
To get this far, you'll want to have `node`, `npm`, and `yarn` available.

### `yarn` install

If running
```sh
which yarn
```
does not output anything, yarn may need to be installed.
_(If you installed `node` using `brew` on a shared Mac, login as the user who installed `brew`.)_

If `yarn` is not yet installed
```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

If for whatever reason you can't install `yarn`, but `npm` is available to you,
you can follow along substituting `npm run` instead of `yarn` in your repo.

### Project bootstrapping with `vite-express`

To make bring your environment up to this one, run
```sh
yarn create vite-express
```
- Project name: `my-material-todo-express` (or whatever you want that isn't the same as mine)
- Select a framework: `React`
- Do you use TypeScript? `y`

And now everything should be the same, except you won't have this README file.

When you are ready for the next step, run this command:

```sh
yarn next
```
